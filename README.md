# Dual-Arm-Cartesian-Control
This repository contains the initial setup and partial implementation of a dual-arm robotic system in ROS 2 (Jazzy). The work includes dual-arm URDF integration, visualization in RViz, and controller scaffolding for Cartesian control. The task is currently in progress, with focus on system architecture, robot description, controller configuration
